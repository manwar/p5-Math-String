This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.22) over the last
version, since CHANGES is now quite big:

* scale parameter to new() needs listing as allowed
* added method copy() to Math::String::Charset
* made Math::String::Charset::Wordlist into it's own distribution

* 595 tests (scale => $N as parameter to new(), copy())
