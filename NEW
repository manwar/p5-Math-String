This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.24) over the last
version, since CHANGES is now quite big:

* new( { str => ..., num => ... } ) did not take a possible scale from the
  charset into account
* added tests for new() with two-arg-form and scaled charset
* prerequisite Math::BigInt v1.67
* 599 tests
