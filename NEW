This lists only the changes for the current release (v1.12) over the last
version, since HISTORY is now quite big:

* fixed bzero() for $x->bzero() case (Math::String::bzero() did work)
* added bnan() and binf()
* there were no tests for bzero(), bnan() and binf()
* fixed bug in from_number() that did not copy all values form BigInt (due to
  new Math::BigInt::Calc $x->{value} might not be an ARRAY any longer)
