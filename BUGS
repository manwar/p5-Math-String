Known bugs:

* General:
  + divide by zero throws no exception

* Math::String
  + :constant does not work (uses integers instead of strings)
* Math::String::Charset::Nested
  + bigram support does not yet fully work (str2num and num2str are missing)
* Math::String::Charset::Grouped
  + $x->length() does not always work (like in Dev::Bollocks)

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
